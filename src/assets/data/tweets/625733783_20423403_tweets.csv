"<|startoftext|>A lot of people hate on college. 

They think if you've got a biz in the digital realm then you should take care of yourself.

But many people who do get a biz in the digital realm think this is a problem only in the digital realm.

That's not true.

A huge biz problem is that most startups fail when they don't have big names.

That's why we created the College Game Jam. We answered questions, made better content, and raised more money from more than 1m people.

Game Jam is:

•5v5
•We're proud investors
•600k monthly active user
•overweight
•20+ million monthly monthly subscribers
